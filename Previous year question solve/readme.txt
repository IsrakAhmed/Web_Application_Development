Question :

Created a Node.js module using an Express router to support the routes for the library REST API.

Base url
http://localhost:3000/library/

Endpoints
/books
/books/|bookid|
/books/|bookname|

You need to support GET, PUT, POST and DELETE operations on each of the endpoints mentioned above.

Use mongodb schema and model (use any MongoDB hosted database i.e mlab.com) to store data for books API and then extend the Express REST API server to support the /books REST API endpoints.


To preview the operation use postman app.
Write api documentation using apiary.io.
For version control of your code, use git and github (private repo).
